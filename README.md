# rock-paper-scissors
### This repo was created to revisit my first domain, rock-paper-scissors.org

Registered in 2001 or 2002, the initial site was a static grid showing some game related images.
Several years later, I found a script online and modified it to add game play to the site.
Now a decade or so later, I have used an archive of that version of the code to create this repo.
I intend to update this code to use more modern methods and the knowledge I have gained since it's inception almost 20 years ago.
Once completed, the code will go back into production on the old domain.
